# self-reference
This program outputs its source code.

Self reference is the basis of the limitations of computational machines (see halting problem), and some even believe that it might be the origin of consciousness in humans (we are conscious because we think and we can also think about ourselves thinking). These two are contradictory however. An interesting question is "what is the relation between the human mind and finite machines?": the brain, and the body in general, is a finite machine and there is a relation between it and the mind (the proof is that I couldn't be writing this if I drank a bottle on wine first :)). Can the mind solve problems that computers can't? If so, then it must be more than just a finite machine, which imposes the very hard question "what is that 'more'". If, on the other hand, the mind is a finite machine, then it means that it is possible to build an artificial one (which is so cool, but still doesn't mean that we could manage it). 

This is an interesting topic and I don't want to work on my software engineering project right now :D
